# Data Jobs Dashboard w/ Power BI




## Introduction

This dashboard was created for **Job Seekers, Job Transitioners, and Job Swappers** to solve a common problem: information about the data job market is scattered and hard to grasp. Using a real-world dataset of 2024 data science job postings (including titles, salaries, and locations), this project provides a single, easy-to-use interface to explore market trends and work compensation.

### Dashboard File
You can find the file for the dashboard here: [`data_jobs_dashboard.pbix`](data_jobs_dashboard.pbix).  
Extra dashboard utilizing additional features such as measures, parameters, more DAX implementation. [`Data_Jobs_Dashboard_2.0`](Data_Jobs_Dashboard_2.0).

## Skills Showcased

This project was a journey through key Power BI features. Here's a look at what we mastered:

-    Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query: Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
-    Implicit Measures: Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Median Yearly Salary` and `Job Count`.
-    Core Charts: Utilized **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area Charts** to compare job counts and track trends over time.
-    Geospatial Analysis: Leveraged **Map Charts** to visualize the global distribution of jobs.
-    KPI Indicators & Tables: Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data.
-    Dashboard Design: Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
-    Interactive Reporting:
    -   **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
    -   **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
    -   **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.
